## Section 1
Identifying Accidents Using Object Detection

### Subsection 1.1
We will use our custom-trained models to detect serious accidents that require emergency response from SCDF. Using IBM Cloud Object Storage instance, we will store 200 images of different road accidents with different labels to prepare the data for training. There will be **five** main categories of major accidents:
1. Vehicle on fire/smoking
2. Overturned Light Vehicle (Car/Van/Small Truck)
3. Overturned Heavy Vehicle (Large Trucks/Container)
4. Badly Crushed Vehicle
5. Severe Motorcycle Crash

The model will be trained to differentiate between an event (major accident) and non-event (minor accident/no accident) to ensure that SCDF's precious resources are not activated without cause.
